    "#Public members (generally methods declared in a class) are accessible from outside the class. \n",
    "#The object of the same class is required to invoke a public method. This arrangement of private\n",
    "#instance variables and public methods ensures the principle of data encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Protected members of a class are accessible from within the class and are also available\n",

    "\n",
